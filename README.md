# :cherries: Cherri (Computational Help Evaluating RNA-RNA interactions) :cherries:

Cherri detects functional RNA-RNA interactions (RRI) sites, by evaluatioting if a interaction site most likely occurs in nature.
It will help to filter false positive interaction sites, which can be generated either experimentaly or by a RRI prediction algorithms. 

## Progamm Idea:
Cherri can be run in two modes the model gemeration or **train** mode or the RRI evaluation or **eval** mode. The figure illustares the workflow of Cherri:

<img src="./plots/Cherri_workflow_resuctured2.svg " alt="Cherri_workflow" width="550"/>


For the evaluation a model must be specifeyed. This can me generated by the user it self in the trainings mode or using the tools pretrained models.
To train a novel model the input data should be an RNA-RNA interactome specifiying all RRIs sites within the organim. Cherri makes use of replicat data by checking if the RRIs can be found in all replicat within a overlap trashold. This is how it makes up the set of trusted RRIs. In the evaluation mode the Interaction posistions are reformated in the same way as the trusted RRIs. Than in bothe cases Cerris core method can be run to generate the trainings or feature set wich will be in the train mode used for model selection and in the evaluation mode used for the classification of the instaces. 




## Instalation

Cherri developed in Linux and tested on Ubuntu (18.04 LTS). For the installation on your conda is required. 


### Install Conda

If you do not have Conda yet, you can e.g. install miniconda, a free + lightweight Conda installer. Get miniconda [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), choose the Python 3.8 Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit installer and follow the installation instructions. In the end, Conda should be accessed on the command line via (possibly in a more advanced version):

```
$ conda --version
conda 4.10.3
```

### Install Cherri Conda package **not woring jet**

Cherri is available as a Conda package [here](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/).

We recommend to create a new Conda environment inside which we will then install cherri:

```
conda create -n cherri python=3.8 cherri -c conda-forge -c bioconda
```
Or install it into your favorite existing environment
```
conda install -c bioconda cherri
```

If you are experiencing problems while running `conda install -c bioconda cherri` (e.g. complaints about conflicting dependencies), the following commands should do the trick:

```
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

This tells conda to explicitly look for packages in the specified channels, stored in the `.condarc` [conda configuration file](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html).

You additionally need to fix the python hash seed:

```
conda env config vars set PYTHONHASHSEED=31337
```
Please reactivate the enviorment to activate the PYTHONHASHSEED evniormetn variable.
Now Cherri should be available inside the environment:


```
cherri -h
```

### Manual installation

To manually install Cherri, you first create a Conda environment. Inside the environment, you need to install the following dependencies:

```
conda create -n cherri python=3.8 -c conda-forge -c bioconda
conda activate cherri
```

And than install the following dependencies:

```
conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn
conda install -c conda-forge networkx
conda install -c bioconda ucsc-twobittofa
conda install -c bioconda interlap
conda install -c bioconda IntaRNA
conda install -c bioconda numpy
conda install -c bioconda pandas
conda install -c smautner eden-kernel
conda install -c smautner biofilm=0.0.88
conda install -c conda-forge python-wget
```
Or create the environment with all dependencies at ones:

```
conda create -n cherri -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c smautner scikit-learn networkx ucsc-twobittofa interlap pandas IntaRNA python-wget eden-kernel biofilm=0.0.88 python-wget

```

Finally, to install the tool itself, we simply clone the repository and execute the installation script inside the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/teresa-m/Cherri.git
cd Cherri
python -m pip install . --ignore-installed --no-deps -vv 
```

You additionally need to fix the python hash seed:

```
conda env config vars set PYTHONHASHSEED=31337
```
or just for your current session!
```
export PYTHONHASHSEED=31337
```

Now we can run Cherri from any given folder (just remember to re-activate the environment once you open a new shell):

```
cherri -h
```

Cherri was tested with the following versions: 0.1. 

## Usage
You can use Cherri in two modes. The eval mode predicts weather the positions of your RRI prediction is biological relevant. Precomputed models exist for human or mouse data and can be downloaded. If you would like to build a model based on novel RRI interactome data you can use the train mode.
If you did clone the Cherri  form GitHub you can test Cherri by running the example calls, calling Cherri one level befor the Cherri repostory folder. 

### Mode eval   :  evaluation of RRIs
Based on a tabular file containing chromosomal position data of the RRIs, Cherri classify if the interaction region is likely to be a biolocal relevant one.

Cherris models are trained for human and mouse, which can be directly used for RRIs position evaluation. If there exists a RNA-RNA-interactome dataset for your preferred organism we recommend to train your own organism specific model using cherris train mode. This model can be than use in the eval mode for the classification of your predicted RRIs positions.

The pretrained models can be downloaded from [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6533932#.Ynu--FxBwUE)  DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6533931.


#### Input format of the RRI evaluation table (RRIs_table)
The to evaluate instances should in a tabular format. You should specify a header lines, with the chromosome interaction start interaction end and strand of the two interacting partners:
```
chrom1,start1,stop1,strand1,chrom2,start2,stop2,strand2
```
With a specific setting only 'positive' instances are computed. If no additional occupied regions are specified only the once of the given input interactions are used. However, we recommend to specify the occupied regions of the trained model, to be consisted within the feature generation.

#### Example call Cherri train evaluation mode
```
cherri train -i1 ./Cherri/test_data/training/Paris/ -r miRNA_human_1.tabular miRNA_human_2.tabular miRNA_human_3.tabular -g /vol/scratch/data_storage/data/genomes/hg38_UCSC_20210318.2bit -l /vol/scratch/data_storage/data/genomes/hg38_Info.tab -o /vol/scratch/data_storage/ -n paris_human_test -c 50 -st on -t 10000 -me 8000 -j 7

### Mode train: built new Cherri model
To train mode of Cherri enables you to train your own model. 
Using Chira RRI output data 'ChiRA interaction summary' table for "build model" mode will generate a prediction classifier.
If you you want to prepare the 'ChiRA interaction summary' table please follow the [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material//topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-interactome/tutorial.html).


#### Retive RNA-RNA interactome files
Please select the Chira RRI output files as input for cherri train. You should specify the path to the folders containing all replicats. If you want to filer for interactions, where Chira also alrady found a hyprid within its analysis you should enalble the hybritsation with the Chira workflow and set for Cherri the filter_hybrid pararmter as 'on'. Some of the possible interaction maid be missed this way, but it will also filter out potential false postive interactions.

## Cherris core method scripts
Cherri is build as a modular tool calling individual scrips doing specific tasks. If you would like to only perform one step of the Cherri piplein you can do this by calling the individual scrips. A short description of this scripts is given in the following.


### RRI detection: find_trusted_RRI.py
Here we search for trusted RRIs, so RRIs which can be found in all replicates. In a first filter step only uniquely mapped RRIs are taken. Than RRI sequence partners in all replicas are found, using a overlap threshold. Output are the Chira input tables, now containing only the trusted RRIs. Only one of the sequence RRI pairs is added to the output.
